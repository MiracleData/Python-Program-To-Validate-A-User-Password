# Python-Program-To-Validate-A-User-Password
This Python program is designed to interact with users by prompting them to input a password of their choice. Subsequently, the program evaluates whether the entered password satisfies specific criteria. If the password meets these requirements, it's labeled as a "Valid Password"; otherwise, it's deemed an "Invalid Password." In cases where the password fails to meet the criteria, the program provides detailed explanations for its invalidity.

To achieve this, the program consists of distinct functions, each tasked with assessing different aspects of the password. These functions evaluate the password against the following conditions:

Length Requirement: This function verifies that the password contains a minimum of eight characters.
Uppercase and Lowercase Letters: It ensures that the password includes at least one uppercase and one lowercase letter.
Presence of Numerals: This function checks whether the password contains at least one numerical digit.
Special Characters: It validates whether the password contains at least one special character from the set: !, @, #, or $.
Each function accepts the user's password as input and returns True if the condition is met; otherwise, it returns False. By evaluating the password against these conditions, the program provides comprehensive feedback to the user, ensuring they understand why their password may be deemed invalid.
